# Overview

This project was created to verify that my local development environment is properly configured and that I can successfully write, run, document, and publish software using industry-standard tools. As a software engineer, establishing a reliable workflow early is critical for building more complex applications in the future.

The software is a simple "Hello World" program written in JavaScript that outputs text to the console. While minimal in functionality, it demonstrates the complete development lifecycle: writing code, executing it, documenting the solution, and publishing both the code and supporting materials.

The purpose of this project is to confirm that my programming environment, version control setup, and documentation process are working correctly before progressing to more advanced software development tasks.
